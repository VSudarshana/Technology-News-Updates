This project aims to develop a Chrome extension that displays the latest technology news updates. The extension will use the News API to fetch the news and inject it into the DOM. The news will be displayed in a popup window when users click on the extension's icon in the Chrome toolbar. Each headline in the popup window will be linked to the article, and the link will open in a new tab when clicked.
